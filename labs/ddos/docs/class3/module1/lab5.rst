Lab 5 - Bad Actor Detection Demo
================================

In this demo you will run an attack from specific IP addresses. The
Hybrid Defender will be configured to perform bad actor detection, limit
the attack on a per-IP basis with more aggressive thresholds and then,
based on this detection, automatically blacklist the offending IP
address adding them to the (hardware-accelerated) dynamic blacklist.

Task 1 - Open the following tabs in the DHD UI
----------------------------------------------

-  **DoS Protection->Quick Configuration->ServerNet**

-  **Security->DoS Protection->DoS Overview** (leave filter at default:
   “DoS Attack”)

-  **Statistics->DoS Visibility**

-  **Security->Event Logs->Network->IP Intelligence**

Task 2 – Configure the following UDP Flood vectors for ServerNet
----------------------------------------------------------------

- **DoS Protection->Quick Configuration->ServerNet**

Set the following:
  DDoS Settings: UDP, Sweep

  - Click **UDP Flood**

    - Detection Threshold PPS: 1000

    - Detection Threshold Percent: 500

    - Rate Limit: 2000

  - Bad Actor Detection - Check

    - Per Source IP Detection PPS: 100

    - Per Source IP Rate Limit PPS: 2000

  - Blacklist Attacking Address

    - Detection Time: 15

    - Duration: 120

- Click **Update** when finished.

- Access the **Attacker** system CLI and run the UDP flood attack:

  .. code-block:: console

     # cd ~/scripts
     # ./udp_flood.sh

  From the menu, select ‘1’ to start the attack

  .. code-block:: console

     root@attacker-a:~/scripts# ./udp_flood.sh

     1)Attack start
     2)Attack end
     3)Quit

     # ?

.. NOTE:: This attack is relatively short-lived. You can launch it
   again if the attack ends and you are not finished viewing the various
   reports. Simply type ‘1’ again, to re-run the attack.

- In the Hybrid Defender UI, show the **Security > DoS Protection >DoS Overview** page. Note the blocks by Bad Actor.

- In the Hybrid Defender UI, show the **Security > Event Logs > Network >
  IP Intelligence** Event Logs. Note the IP addresses that are being
  added to the denial\_of\_service blacklist.

- In the Hybrid Defender WebUI, show the **Statistics >** **DoS
  Visibility**. Expand the Vectors inspector and select UDP Flood. When
  it updates, select a flood from the timeline. Note in the Attacks
  panel the #IPs blocked is 10.

From the menu, select ‘2’ to end the attack

or

.. code-block:: console

   # sudo bash
   # killall -9 hping3
