Lab 4 - Multi-vector Demo
=========================

In this simple demo you will launch a small number of network attacks
and show the configuration, logging and reporting capabilities of the
Hybrid Defender. The point of this demo is to provide context for a UI
walkthrough with some live data.

Task 1 - Access DoS Quick Configuration and display the **ServerNet** protected object
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This protected object is defending all ports/protocols for 10.1.20.0/24,
which is the network behind the Hybrid Defender. Attacks will be
launched at 10.1.20.12, which is an interface on the LAMP server. Verify
that the following vectors are configured:

-  Add the TCP vectors under DDoS Settings.

- Click **Update** when finished.

You will now launch the attacks and show the behavior

- Open the following tabs in the DHD UI:

- **DoS Protection->Quick Configuration->ServerNet**

- **Security->DoS Protection->DoS Overview** (leave the filter at
  default: ’DoS Attack’)

- **Statistics->DoS Visibility**

- Access the **Attacker** shell and run the following commands/attack

  .. code-block:: console

     # cd ~/scripts
     # ./multivector.sh

- Click **Refresh** on the DoS Overview page. You will see some attacks mitigated by **Device Configuration** and some mitigated by the more specific settings on the **ServerNet Protected Object**.

  |image36|

Navigate to **Security->Event Logs->DoS->Network->Events**.

- Click on “custom search…” link.

- Drag one of the values from the “Attack Type” column into the custom
  search builder. From the Action column, drag Drop into the search
  builder. Click “Search”.

  |image37|

- Further explore the DoS Event logs. For example, clear the search and identify the “Stop” and “Start” times for an attack, etc.

Task 2 – View the DoS Visibility Page
-------------------------------------

You can now use the new DoS Visibility page to view statistics about the DoS attacks you submitted during this exercise.

- In the Hybrid Defender WebUI, access the DoS Visibility reporting
  tool at **Statistics->DoS Visibility.**

.. NOTE:: DoS Visibility is a reporting tool, not a real-time
   monitoring tool. Events are displayed, much like other AVR-based
   reporting, in 5 minute windows. Do not expect events to be shown here
   immediately after running an attack. Quicker/real-time monitoring of on-going
   DoS attacks is best accomplished in the DoS Event Logs and DoS Overview areas
   of the WebUI.

- You should see the attacks in the timeline and a variety of details in
  the windows. Use the slider to shorten the timeframe if needed. You might have to hit refresh several times.

  |image38|

- You can select events from the timeline and see details about the attacks.

  |image39|

- In the **Attack Duration** window view the attack.

  - Scroll down in the left-side of the page to view the **Attacks** section.

- View the details at the bottom of the **Attacks** section.

  |image30|

  This table displays details of each attack that has occurred.

- Sort this table by **Vector**.

  |image31|

- Scroll down in the left-side of the page to view the **Virtual Servers** section.

  You can see the details of device-wide attacks (**Device Level**) and
  protected object-level attacks (**/Common/ServerNet**).

- Scroll down in the left-side of the page to view the Countries section.

- View the details at the bottom of the **Countries** section. This table displays the attack details from each country.

- View the various widgets in the panel on the right-side of the page.

- Click **Network** to filter out only the network-level attacks (all the attacks so far have been network-level).

    |image32|

- If it’s not already expanded, expand the **Virtual Servers** widget, and then select **/Common/ServerNet**.

- This filters the results to only attacks at this protected object-level. Notice the changes to the map on in the **Countries** section.

- Click **/Common/ServerNet** to remove the filter.

- Drag the resize handle on the right-side of the main window as far to the left as possible.

    |image33|

- Expand the **Vectors** widget, and then select **ICMPv4 flood**.

- Expand the **Client IP Addresses** widget.

Question:   How many client IP addresses contributed to this attack?

- Expand the **Countries** widget.

- Sort the countries by **Dropped Requests**.

  |image34|

- Select **China**, and then view the changes to both the **Client IP Addresses** widget and the map.

- At the top of the page open the **Analysis** page.

.. NOTE:: The requests are still filtered for the ICMPv4 flood results for China.

- Drag the resize handle on the as far to the right as possible.

- Examine the Avg Throughput (Bits per second) graph.

- Place your mouse over the peak in the graph.

Question: What is the **Average client in throughput** during the attack?

- Feel free to examine more of the **Dashboard** page and the **Analysis** page.

- Type **Ctrl + C** to stop the attack.
