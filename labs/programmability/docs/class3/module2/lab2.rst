3. Create an Address List
--------------------------

An HTTP POST to the ``/mgmt/tm/security/firewall/address-list/`` endpoint with a body containing the configuration creates an address list that can be used with a firewall policy.

**Request**

::

    POST https://{{big_ip_a_mgmt}}/mgmt/tm/security/firewall/address-list/

**Headers**

:: 

    Content-Type: application/json
    X-F5-Auth-Token: {{big_ip_a_auth_token}}

**Body**

::

    {
        "name": "google-dns_address_list",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "name": "8.8.4.4"
            }
        ]
    }

**Example Response**

.. note:: Copy the **name** of the address list, highlighted below, from the response into the **afm_address_list** Postman environment variable.

.. code-block:: rest
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 8-12

    {
        "kind": "tm:security:firewall:address-list:address-liststate",
        "name": "google-dns_address_list",

            {
                "name": "8.8.4.4"
            }
        ]
    }

    }

5. Update Firewall Address List
--------------------------------

An HTTP PATCH to the ``/mgmt/tm/security/firewall/address-list/{{afm_address_list}}`` endpoint with a body containing all addresses that should exist in the address list will update this collection.

**Headers**

:: 

    Content-Type: application/json
