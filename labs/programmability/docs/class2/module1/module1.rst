===========================================

In this module, we will explore how to use the **f5-super-netops-container**
toolkit to easily integrate various F5 Automation, Orchestration, Super-NetOps
and DevOps tools, along with framework technologies.

The f5-super-netops-container is meant to be provided as a technical leave
behind, a functional solution that contains tools (which we will use in this
Class) and documentation around F5 Cloud Solutions. The container is
**continuously updated** to always include our latest information.

The labs in this module will show you how to install the
f5-super-netops-container image; you can also start it in your local
environment and access the same various tools and documentation.

To install the f5-super-netops-container, your system must
support running Docker Community Edition (CE).  Please refer to
