In this module you will learn the basic concepts required to interact
with the BIG-IP iControl REST API. Additionally, you will walk through a
typical Device Onboarding workflow to deploy a fully functional
BIG-IP Active/Standby pair. Itâ€™s important to note that this module will
focus on demonstrating an **Imperative** approach to automation.

.. NOTE:: The Lab Deployment for this lab includes two BIG-IP devices.
   For most of the labs, we will only be configuring the BIG-IP A
   device (management IP configuration and licensing has been completed).
   BIG-IP B will have some minimal configuration pre-loaded. In real-world
   scenario, it would be necessary to perform Device Onboarding functions
   on ALL BIG-IP devices. In this lab exercise, we chose to perform it only
   on a single device due to lab time allocation constraints.

.. NOTE:: In order to confirm the results of REST API calls made in this lab, it's
   recommended to keep GUI/SSH sessions to BIG-IP and iWorkflow devices open.
   By default, BIG-IP and iWorkflow will log all the REST API related events locally
   to **restjavad.0.log** . These logs can also be directed to a remote syslog server
   (see https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13080). On a side note, the **ltm**
   log files listed below contains log messages specific to  BIG-IP local
   traffic management events.

   - BIG-IP:

     - /var/log/ltm

     - /var/log/restjavad.0.log

   - iWorkflow:

     - /var/log/restjavad.0.log
