organizations are being compromised by sophisticated attacks which blend
techniques with automated tools to cause delay or disruption to

-  Is my organization prepared to handle floods of HTP traffic?

-  Does my team know vulnerabilities and how to mitigate an attack,
   while maintaining availability of applications for our customers?
