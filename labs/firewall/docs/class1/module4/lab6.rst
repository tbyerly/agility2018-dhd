WORKFLOW 2: Interacting with the data in the dashboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You can narrow the scope of what is graphed by selecting an object
   or objects from the selection panels on the right. For example, if
   you only want to see data from BIG-IP01, you can click on it to
   filter the data.

-  You can create complex filters by making additional selections in
   other panels

-  You can zoom in on a time, by selecting a section of a graph or
   moving the slider at the top of the page

   or

-  All the graphs update to the selected time.

-  You can change how far in the data you want to look back by using
   the selection in the upper left (note you may need to let some time
   elapse before this option becomes available)

WORKFLOW 3: Getting to the statistics from the configuration/property pages for an object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   launch the stats page from the configuration table or properties
   page.

-  Navigate to Configuration→Local Traffic → Virtual Servers

-  Select the object you want to see stats for, click the more button,
   and click view statistics

   Or open the properties page of a virtual server and click the view
   statistics button in the upper right
