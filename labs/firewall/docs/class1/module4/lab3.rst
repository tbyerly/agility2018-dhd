Changes to BIG-IQ User Interface
================================

The user interface in the 5.2 release navigation has changed to a more
UI tab based framework.

In this section, we will go through the main features of the user
interface. Feel free to log into the BIG-IQ device to explore some of
these features in the lab.

After you log into BIG-IQ, you will notice:

-  A navigation tab model at the top of the screen to display each high
   level functional area.

-  A tree based menu on the left-hand side of the screen to display
   low-level functional area for each tab.

-  A large object browsing and editing area on the right-hand side of
   the screen.

-  Let us look a little deeper at the different options available in the
   bar at the top of the page.

-  At the top, each tab describes a high-level functional area for
   BIG-IQ central management:

-  Monitoring –Visibility in dashboard format to monitor performance and
   isolate fault area.

-  Configuration – Provides configuration editors for each module area.

-  Deployment – Provides operational functions around deployment for
   each module area.

-  Devices – Lifecycle management around discovery, licensing and
   software install / upgrade.

-  System – Management and monitoring of BIG-IQ functionality.

-  Overview of left hand navigation for each top-level functional area.

BIG-IQ 5.2 has introduced “\ **global search**\ ” which was added to the
BIG-IQ toolbar top here, and will be explored further in this lab.

Next to the username, there is an icon of a person. If you click on that
icon, a menu appears to allow a user to logout of BIG-IQ.
