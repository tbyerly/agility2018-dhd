Module 6: External Logging Devices (SevOne)
===========================================

BIG-IQ Central Management Version - 5.1 has introduced the ability to
integrate with SevOne’s Performance Logging Appliance (PLA) for high
speed logging and reporting.

With SevOne, you can move beyond traditional log search, into real-time troubleshooting of log data at scale. That’s because it extracts terabytes of log data daily and correlates it to performance events, thereby eliminating the need for search in your process. It also increases application performance visibility by providing single-click drill-down from related data — SNMP metrics to NetFlow records to syslog files, for example

-  Automatically correlate real-time performance metrics with log data.

-  Improve visibility of the root cause of performance degradation.

-  Receive proactive alerts of customer and end-user behavioral trends.

-  Decrease time-to-troubleshoot with integrated metrics, flow and logs.

-  Eliminate timely error code analysis with fully configurable
   value-based lookups.

-  Get targeted and intelligent anomaly detection using multiple log
   metrics across many devices in real-time.

-  Leverage multi-variable alerting of log data to identify issues and
   trends.

-  Gain a greater understanding of how configuration changes impact
   application performance.
