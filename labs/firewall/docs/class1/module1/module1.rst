==================================

In this lab, you will create a pool of servers to be load balanced
behind the BIG-IP. You will then experiment with AFM policies to permit
and deny traffic and examine the AFM logging and reporting capabilities.
In subsequent labs you will experiment with the DDoS mitigation features
of AFM.
