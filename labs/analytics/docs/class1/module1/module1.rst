Module 1: Introduction to AVR
=============================

The Application Visibility and Reporting (AVR) module provides detailed
charts and graphs to give you more insight into the performance of web
applications, TCP traffic, DNS traffic, as well as system performance
(CPU, memory, etc.). You can use this module to visualize the traffic
being processed by your BIG-IP device, and gain a better understanding
of where the traffic is originating from (client IP addresses / subnets
as well as geographical regions), the nature and volume of request and
response traffic (Total Transactions as well as Average and Max
Transactions/sec), the most commonly requested URLs, Server Latency and
Page Load times, Virtual Server and Pool member performance, and many
more metrics. This lab will give you a brief introduction on how to
setup the AVR module to generate these charts / reports and how to
visualize them on your BIG-IP.
