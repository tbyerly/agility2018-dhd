Module 2: Integration with Splunk
=================================

Splunk is a 3\ :sup:`rd`-party Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) solution that is used by a large number of organizations to
assimilate information and event logs from a large number of disparate
sources, and store and analyze it from a single central location in
order to correlate data across all devices in the organization.

In this lab, we will integrate our BIG-IPs to send data into Splunk, and
use Splunk to visualize and analyze the data from a single centralized
location rather than viewing/analyzing it on an individual BIG-IP.
