Class 1: Introduction to F5 Analytics
=====================================

In this class, you will be introduced to a few different ways to
gather, visualize and analyze traffic information available on a BIG-IP
platform. It is assumed that you are familiar with the basics of setting
up a BIG-IP device for various ADC functions. Hence, in order to focus
maximum time on the Analytics portion of the lab, the lab environment
has been setup with an HA pair of BIG-IP Virtual Editions (VEs) that
have been pre-configured for a few web applications. Your task will be
to configure the BIG-IPs to generate Analytics data so that you may
visualize and analyze this data.
