Listeners
############################################

A listener object is an specialized virtual server that is configured to respond to DNS queries.

We will be creating both TCP and UDP based listeners that have the same IP address of the existing DNS server.

Note: the Workstation is configured to use 10.1.70.200 and 10.1.70.210 for DNS.

After this module students will have enabled the BIG-IP to intercept and cache DNS requests.
