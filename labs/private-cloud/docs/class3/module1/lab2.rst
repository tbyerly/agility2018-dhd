Lab 2: Executing the playbooks
------------------------------

iWorflow
~~~~~~~~

Let’s login to iWorkflow and have a look at the configuration before we
run the playbook

Let us first execute the playbook on iWorkflow. This playbook will
perform the following tasks

-  Discover device

-  Create a cloud connector

-  Create a service template – Parameters than are tenant editable on
   this template are

   -  Virtual IP

   -  Virtual Port

   -  Load balancing method

   -  Pool members

To execute the playbook run command:

#. SSH to the “Tools” host

#. Go to the ``/root`` directory

#. ``ansible-playbook --step playbooks/iworkflow_setup.yaml``

   .. NOTE:: The playbook will be run step by step, after the first task
      device discovery, make sure before you go to the next step the
      device is discovered correctly and the BIG-IP is in a healthy
      state

#. The following gets created on iWorkflow after playbook(``iworkflow_setup.yaml``)
   execution

   |image5|

#. Once executed the playbook downloads the device package to the
   playbooks directory. Open WinSCP again and move this downloaded device
   package to desktop on your dcloud environment. Name of the device
   package is picked up from the variable file**

Manual step to upload Device Package to APIC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to APIC UI, login with ``admin``/``C1sco12345``

#. Click on L4-L7 services->Packages->Import a device package

   |image6|

#. Click on Browse and then select the device package present on the
   desktop

#. Once uploaded, you can view the device package contents on the left-hand
   side of the pane

APIC
~~~~

Let’s login to APIC and have a look at the configuration before we run
the playbook

Let us now execute the playbooks on APIC.

#. Log back into the ‘Tools’ host, go to the ``/root`` directory

   Playbook ``aci_tenant_setup.yaml`` – this playbook will perform the
   following tasks

   -  Create a tenant

   -  Create a Private Context

   -  Create two bridge domains

   -  Create an application profiles

   -  Create two EPG (End Point Groups)

   -  Create a contract

#. To execute the playbook run command

   ``ansible-playbook --step playbooks/aci_tenant_setup.yaml``

#. The following gets created on APIC after playbook (``aci_tenant_setup.yaml``)
   execution

   |image8|

#. Playbook ``logical_device_cluster.yaml`` – this playbook will perform
   the following tasks

   -  Create a device manager type

   -  Create a device manager in tenant common

   -  Create a logical device cluster in tenant common

#. To execute the playbook run command

   ``ansible-playbook --step playbooks/logical_device_cluster.yaml``

#. The following gets created on APIC after playbook
   (``logical_sevice_cluster.yaml``) execution

   #. Device Manager Type under L4-L7 services->Inventory->Device Manager
      Types

      |image9|

   #. Device Manager under Tenant common ->L4-L7 services->Device Managers

      |image10|

   #. Logical device cluster under tenant common -> L4-L7 Devices. **Make sure
      before proceeding to the next step that your logical device cluster is
      in ‘Stable’ state**

      |image11|

   #. On the BIG-IP a device group will be created which has the same name as
      that of the logical device cluster

      |image12|

#. Playbook ``service_insertion.yaml`` - this playbook will perform the
   following tasks

   -  Export the logical device cluster from tenant common to user tenant

   -  Create a service graph template

   -  Assign L4-L7 BIG-IP parameters (VIP, Port etc.) to the graph

   -  Create a device selection policy

   -  Then attach the service graph template to the contract

#. To execute the playbook run command

   ``ansible-playbook --step playbooks/service_insertion.yaml``

#. The following gets created on APIC after playbook (``service_insertion.yaml``)
   execution

   |image13|

#. You can view the BIG-IP parameters that get configured under provider
   EPG. Click on the pencil edit button, select the appropriate
   graph/contract and node. Click on the ‘all parameters’ tab to view all
   the details

   |image14|

Verify
~~~~~~

Verify successful deployment of network and application parameters on
the APIC, iWorkflow, BIG-IP

#. On the APIC make sure the graph is deployed and the state is ‘applied’

   |image16|

#. View the deployed devices tab and take node of the Virtual device ID.
   This will be the identified on the BIG-IP with which you can associate
   the partition created on the BIG-IP to the graph deployed on the APIC.
   Also keep note of the VLAN tags

   |image17|

#. On the iWorkflow, make sure there is a

   -  Tenant created which will map to a BIG-IP partition

   -  A L4-L7 service which will map to the virtual server configured on
      the BIG-IP

   -  Nodes are created which map to the node members created on the BIG-IP

   |image18|

#. On the BIG-IP make sure a partition is created (note the partition is
   referencing the Virtual ID generated by APIC).

   - Click on ‘Network Map’ to get a unified view of the objects deployed on
     the BIG-IP. To see individual objects, click on the appropriate tab from
     the left hand pane

     |image19|

   - To view network related parameters, click on the ‘Network’ tab and then
     view the Self IP’s and the VLAN information. The Self IP information is
     user driver (part of the service graph). The VLAN information is
     dynamically generated by APIC which is configured on the BIG-IP
