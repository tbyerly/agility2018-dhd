Class 2: Deploying Cisco APIC with F5 iWorkflow and BIG-IP
==========================================================

**About This Solution**


The **Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller** (Cisco APIC)
is the unifying point of automation and management for the **Cisco
Application Centric Infrastructure** (Cisco ACI™) fabric. The Cisco APIC
provides centralized access to all fabric information, optimizes the
application lifecycle for scale and performance, supporting flexible
application provisioning across physical and virtual resources.

**About This Demonstration**

This preconfigured demonstration includes:

-  Scenario 1: Deploy Service Graph using F5 iApps in Cisco ACI with F5
   iWorkflow

-  Scenario 2: Modify L4 – L7 deployed graph parameters

-  Scenario 3: Remove APIC Service Graph

-  Scenario 4: Using POSTMAN REST client to deploy service graph

There are two options to complete each lab task

(1) Using iWorkflow and APIC UI – Scenario 1

(2) Using POSTMAN REST client (APIC Only) – Scenario 4

The goal of ACI is to accelerate application deployment by building
L4-L7 policy into Cisco ACI model. We recommend using the REST client
model as the most effective way to execute the APIC portion of the lab;
for BIG-IP and iWorkflow, please continue to use the UI. You are
encouraged to use the UI screen shots as a reference to the tasks
executed by POSTMAN.
