Lab 4 - Multi-vector Demo
=========================

In this simple demo you will launch a small number of network attacks
and show the configuration, logging and reporting capabilities of the
Hybrid Defender. The point of this demo is to provide context for a UI
walkthrough with some live data.

Task 1 - Access DoS Quick Configuration and display the ServerNet protected object
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This protected object is defending all ports/protocols for 10.1.20.0/24,
which is the network behind the Hybrid Defender. Attacks will be
launched at 10.1.20.12, which is an interface on the LAMP server. Verify
that the following vectors are configured:

Launch the attacks and show the behavior

- Open the following tabs in the DHD UI:

- **DoS Protection->Quick Configuration->ServerNet**

- **Security->DoS Protection->DoS Overview** (leave the filter at
  default: ’DoS Attack’)

- **Statistics->DoS Visibility**

- Access the Attacker System CLI and run the attack

  .. code-block:: console

    # cd ~/scripts
    # sudo bash
    # ./multivector.sh

  - Click **Refresh** on the DoS Overview page. You will see some attacks
    mitigated by **Device Configuration** and some mitigated by the more
    specific settings on the **ServerNet Protected Object**.

Navigate to **Security->Event Logs->DoS->Network->Events**.

- Click on “custom search…” link.

- Drag one of the values from the “Attack Type” column into the custom
  search builder. From the Action column, drag Drop into the search
  builder. Click “Search”.

- Further explore the DoS Event logs as needed for your demo. For
  example, clear the search and identify the “Stop” and “Start” times
  for an attack, etc.

- In the Hybrid Defender WebUI, access the DoS Visibility reporting
  tool at **Statistics->DoS Visibility.**

.. NOTE:: DoS Visibility is a reporting tool, not a real-time
   monitoring tool. Events are displayed, much like other AVR-based
   reporting, in 5 minute windows. Do not expect events to be shown here
   immediately after running an attack. Be aware of this timing when doing
   a demo. Quicker/real-time monitoring of on-going DoS attacks is best
   accomplished in the DoS Event Logs and DoS Overview areas of the WebUI

- You should see the attacks in the timeline and a variety of details in
  the windows. Use the slider to shorten the timeframe if needed, and
  click the Network filter, to focus on L4 activities.

  .. NOTE:: that you can select events from the timeline and see details
     about the attacks

- Log in to Silverline at https://portal.f5silverline.com.

- Navigate to **Monitor and Analyze > Stats > Hybrid Device**. Locate your
  device and explore the interface.
