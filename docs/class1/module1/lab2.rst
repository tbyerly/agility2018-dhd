Lab 2 – Configuring Hybrid Defender DDoS protection
===================================================

Task 1 – Disable Device-Level DHD DoS Protection
------------------------------------------------

In this lab you will disable **device-level** DoS flood protection, and then
issue an ICMPv4 flood and review the results.

- **PuTTY** to the BIG-IP CLI (10.1.1.245) and resize window by
  making it wider. Login with root/f5DEMOs4u.

- At the **config** prompt, type (or copy and paste) the following
  command:

  ``tcpdump -i 0.0``

- Open a second **PuTTY** window and Load the Attacker Saved Session at
  **10.1.1.7** and log in as **ubuntu**. I't will use **a pre-loaded
  public key** as the credentials.

- At the **config** prompt, type (or copy and paste) the following
  command:

  ``ping 10.1.20.12``

The attacker can successfully communicate with a back-end resource
behind the BIG-IP DHD.

- Examine the **tcpdump** window and verify ICMP packets are flowing
  through the BIG-IP DHD.

.. NOTE:: The listener for the ICMP packets is the VLAN group.

- Cancel the ``ping`` command, then verify the ``tcpdump`` stops receiving
  ICMP packets, and then press **Enter** several times to clear the
  recent log entries.

- In the Configuration Utility, in the **DoS Protection, Quick
  Configuration, Device Protection** section click **Device
  Configuration**.

  |image24|

- In the **Bad Headers** row click the **+** icon, and then click **Bad
  Source**.

- On the right-side of the page select the drop-down to "Don't Enforce"

  |image25|

- In the **Flood** row click the **+** icon, and then click **ICMPv4
  flood**.

.. NOTE:: If you minimize by clicking the + icon, it will make seeing the other
 sections easier.

- On the right-side of the page select the drop-down to "Don't Enforce"

  |image54|

  - Apply the settings above for **TCP SYN flood** and **UDP Flood**.,
    and then click **Update**.

- On the Jumpbox in the **Attacker** PuTTY window type (or copy and
  paste) the following:

  .. Code-block:: console

    # sudo su
    # cd scripts
    # ls

.. NOTE:: Ignore the “unable to resolve host Attacker message”

These are the different scripts we’ll be using during the exercises to
simulate DoS attacks.

- Type (or copy and paste) the following commands:

  ``for i in {1..10}; do ./icmpflood.sh; done``

This script launches 1,000,000 ICMP requests and then repeats for a
total of ten occurrences.

- View the ``tcpdump`` window and verify that ICMP attack traffic is
  reaching the back-end server.

- Let the attack run for about 15 seconds before moving on.

- In the Configuration Utility, open the **Statistics > Performance >
  Performance** page.

- View the Active Connections and Total New Connections charts.

- There is a drastic spike in active connections.

  |image26|

- View the Throughput (bits) and Throughput (packets) charts.

There is also a drastic spike in both bits per second and packets per
second.

- Open the **Security > Event Logs > DoS > Network > Events** page.

The log file is empty as we disabled device-level flood protection on
BIG-IP DHD.

- On the Jumpbox Attacker shell slowly type **Ctrl + C** several times
  until back at the ``scripts`` prompt.

Task 2 – Re-enable Device-Level DHD DoS Protection
-------------------------------------------------------------

In this task you will re-configure **device-level** DoS protection,
and then issue an ICMPv4 flood and review the results.

-  In the Configuration Utility, in the **Device Protection** section
   click **Device Configuration.**

   |image35|

-  In the **Bad Headers** row click the + icon, and then click **Bad
   Source**.

-  On the right-side of the page select the drop-down to **"Enforce"**

   |image36|

-  In the **Flood** row click the + icon, and then click **ICMPv4**
   flood.

-  On the right-side of the page select the drop-down to **"Enforce"**

   |image37|

-  Click **Update**.

.. NOTE:: This returns the configuration back to factory supplied device level
   enforcement.

- On the Jumpbox in the **Attacker A** PuTTY window re-run the
  following command:

  ``for i in {1..10}; do ./icmpflood.sh; done``

- Let the attack run for about 15 seconds before moving on.

- In the Configuration Utility, open the **Security > Dos Protection >
  DoS Overview >** page

- You should see the attacks and statistics. Explore the sections

  |image27|

- In the Configuration Utility, open the **Security > Event Logs > DoS
  > Network > Events** page.

.. NOTE:: You may need to refresh this page several times before the log files display.

- Sort the event by **Time** in descending order.

There are now log entries showing dropped packets.

- The DoS Source is **Volumetric, Aggregated across all SrcIP's,
  Device-Wide attack, metric:PPS**.

- The type is **ICMPv4 flood**.

- The action is **Drop**.

- On the Jumpbox Attacker shell slowly type **Ctrl + C** several times
  until back at the ``scripts`` prompt.
