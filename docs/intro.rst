Introduction to DDoS with F5 DDoS Hybrid Defender
=================================================

F5® DDoS Hybrid Defender™ provides next-generation cloud and on-premises
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) defenses to ensure real-time protections against
volumetric DDoS threats; dynamic network and applications attacks; and threats
hiding within encrypted traffic.

Today’s DDoS attacks are rapidly becoming more severe, more sophisticated, and more complex.
Now, an attack will likely blend different attack vectors that are run simultaneously,
designed to find the weakest link in your infrastructure—whether it’s your network devices,
your applications, or your network bandwidth—and then exploit it.

This class covers the following topics:

- Initial Set-up, Device Configuration, Protected Object Configuration, Launching DDoS Attacks and Viewing Attacks and Logs in the Dashboard.
